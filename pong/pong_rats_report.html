  <b>Severity: High</b><br/>
  Issue: fixed size global buffer<br/>
    Extra care should be taken to ensure that character arrays that are
    allocated on the stack are used safely.  They are prime targets for
    buffer overflow attacks.

  Issue: printf<br/>
    Check to be sure that the non-constant format string passed as argument 1 
    to this function call does not come from an untrusted source that could
    have added formatting characters that the code is not prepared to handle.

  Issue: strcpy<br/>
    Check to be sure that argument 2 passed to this function call will not
    copy more data than can be handled, resulting in a buffer overflow.

  <b>Severity: High</b><br/>
  Issue: gethostbyaddr<br/>
    DNS results can easily be forged by an attacker (or 
arbitrarily set to large values, etc), and should not be trusted.

  Issue: sprintf<br/>
    Check to be sure that the format string passed as argument 2 to this
    function call does not come from an untrusted source that could have added
    formatting characters that the code is not prepared to handle.
    Additionally, the format string could contain `%s' without precision that
    could result in a buffer overflow.
